How To Build
============

1. Setup
--------
Open build.sh and check if the path to the SystemC installation is valid.
I have installed SystemC in /opt/systemc - If your path is different, just change the path in the SYSTEMC variables in build.sh accordingly.

I also use the LLVM C++ Compler clang++. When you want to use the GCC C++ compiler, just replace clang++ by g++.
The compiler must support C++14 standard.
You may want to enable compiler optimization by changing the CPPFLAGS parameters in build.sh

2. Compile
----------
Just execute the build.sh script.
It compiles all cpp-files in this directroy and sub directories.
Then the object files get linked to a binary called model.

The following dependencies exist:
  - SystemC
  - GNU Scientific Library
  - TinyXML2


3. Execution
------------

Save simulated iteration delays

./model -e jpeg7 > results.txt   # save results in a text file


Execute 
./model --help
for more parameters.

To execute multiple instances in parallel use the batchrun.sh script.
There are two variables that may be edited:

  Instances: Number of simulation instances that run in parallel. Best number is the amount of Cores on your host CPU
  Experiment: Name of the experiment that shall be executed.
